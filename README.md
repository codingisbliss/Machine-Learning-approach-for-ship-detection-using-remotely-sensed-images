# Machine-Learning-approach-for-ship-detection-using-remotely-sensed-images
A Research project sponsored by ISRO

I have attached our conference paper that let you know the intentions of the projects and its use.

And then I have also attached code which we used for demonstration, the final code cannot be shared due to privacy agreemnt, However this code will give you general idea to use haar-like-structure algorithm implementation along with SVM to detect ship at high accuracy level.

Please feel free to ask questions!!
